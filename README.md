# Candle-lighting

This is a Vue practice project.
Working with fetch API and extracting data from json.  
Using the Hebcal API https://www.hebcal.com/home/197/shabbat-times-rest-api  
Showing candle lighting times for Jerusalem.  
I would like to eventually build it out so it functions like My Zmanim - https://www.myzmanim.com/day.aspx?vars=27526341
